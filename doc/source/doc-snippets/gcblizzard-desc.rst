This case corresponds to the January 2025 Gulf Coast Blizzard, which brought unprecedented snowfall to the entire Gulf Coast. Leading up to the event, the polar vortex stretched far south and met with unusually warm Gulf waters. In response, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a series of winter storm warnings, extreme cold warnings, and even blizzard warnings â€” the first ever in some areas. New Orleans, LA received a record 8 inches of snow, and the surrounding coastal areas likewise saw record-breaking snowfall and cold temperatures.
